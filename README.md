## Roadmap
- Add more icon packs
- Migrate code generator to Gradle
- Remove icons source from repository and check the abi when generate.
- Improve sample app
- Documentation to how add icon packs

## How the project works

The project uses Kotlin Scripting (main.kts) to download and generate the icons into Compose source code, to generate the source code it uses the tooling library [svg-to-compose](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/svg-to-compose).
