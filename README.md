## How the project works

The project uses Kotlin Scripting (main.kts) to download and generate the icons into Compose source code, to generate the source code it uses the tooling library [svg-to-compose](https://github.com/DevSrSouza/svg-to-compose).

Currently, the Jetpack Compose(Android) and Jetbrains Compose (Desktop/Multiplatform) are a separated artifact and builds, this means that for the library to support both is need artifacts for both.

In the future, when Compose Desktop and Android use the same artifact, the project will migrate to it and use only one artifact for both.
